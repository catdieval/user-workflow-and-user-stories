# Rules of the road

1. Respect! DO NOT belittle about people's coding speed or skills. Everyone is different and it's OK!

2. Communication is key! Communicate clearly and sooner rather than later.

   - Coordinate with other people about which files you are going to work on: this reduces the risk of merging conflicts.

3. Write in your code informative comments in English language when a step is not obvious. This is also part of communication!

4. When you don't know the answer to a coding question, DO NOT ask ChatGPT! Most likely, ChatGPT will output convoluted and meaningless code: this is proven from experience! Rather ask the coach or Google (resources like Stackoverflow are useful).

5. To work on a new feature, do not work directly in the main branch, but create a new branch instead. Do not merge a branch but make a pull request instead.

6. When you write code, test it early to check that it works.

7. Make many small commits rather than a single large commit. Use informative commit messages in English language.
