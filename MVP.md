# Minimal Viable Product

## Uploading data

- Users can upload data files in CSV format.

## Selecting basic charts

- Users can choose from a list of chart types (e.g. line, scatter, bar).

## Selecting which data to plot

- Users can select which data columns to visualize.

## Customizing charts

- Users can give a title and labels to the axes.
- Users can assign plotting properties for the data, such as line color or marker symbol.

## Viewing and interacting with charts

- The charts are interactive, allowing users to hover over data points in the case of markers to see exact values.
- Users can go back to adjust any of the previous choices (plotting properties, title, labels, variable selection) and regenerate the chart.

## Sharing

- Users can export their charts as PNG images for easy sharing or inclusion in reports.

## Making a new chart

- Users can go through the whole process again with different choices to create new charts.
